# HTML & CSS Course Assignment

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the HTML & CSS module for the Frontend Development course at Noroff. The objective was to create a fully functional, responsive website that adheres to the best practices of HTML and CSS. The project follows the design brief selected from **Design 1**, and the website meets all the specified requirements in terms of structure, design, and accessibility.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this assignment was to apply everything learned in the course about HTML and CSS to build a responsive website. The website includes:

- Semantic, valid, and well-formatted HTML
- CSS adhering to the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Responsiveness using Flexbox and CSS Grid (without frameworks like Bootstrap)
- Accessibility considerations following **WCAG** guidelines
- A unique `<meta name="description">`, `<title>`, and `<h1>` for each page

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to various screen sizes without horizontal scrollbars.
- **Semantic HTML**: The code follows HTML5 semantic guidelines for structure and clarity.
- **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: Layouts were created using Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure flexibility and responsiveness.
- **Accessibility**: The website is designed to meet WCAG standards, with accessibility tools like WAVE used to evaluate the site.
- **Unique Metadata**: Each page has unique metadata, including descriptions and titles.
  
## Pages and Structure

The site includes several pages based on the architecture defined in the design brief. Some of the key pages include:

- **Home Page**: Introduces the website's purpose.
- **About Page**: Information about the project or business.
- **Contact Page**: A form to allow visitors to get in touch.
- **Additional Pages**: Depending on the brief, more pages may have been created, including product pages, service listings, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the website content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), and responsiveness.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used to host the website live.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **WCAG Compliance**: Efforts were made to ensure the site is accessible to all users. This includes:
  - Ensuring sufficient color contrast.
  - Using semantic HTML tags.
  - Adding alternative text for images.
  - Testing the site with accessibility tools such as WAVE.
